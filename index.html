            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm an ML scientist at Reveal, where I build AI that helps lawyers find things in mountains of documents. Yes, I'm teaching machines to do discovery so attorneys can bill for something else. You're welcome.</p>
            <p>I took the scenic route: electronics engineering in India, an NLP research stint in France, then a master's in computational linguistics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Now I'm in Chicago, teaching machines to read emails that probably should've been deleted. Career planning is overrated.</p>
            <p>Now I mostly think about retrieval, continual learning (teaching models to learn new things without forgetting the old ones - relatable), and how to make AI systems admit when they don't know something - a skill I'm also working on personally.</p>
            <p>Indian. Based in Chicago. I lift, I travel, I take photos. I tell myself I'll write more. The site exists as evidence of that ongoing lie.</p>
